Hi~ I am Tianyi Fu (付添翼 in Chinese), or T1 simply. I am currently a Master student at Zhejiang University, advised by Dr. [Kai Bu](https://list.zju.edu.cn/kaibu/). In summer of 2022, I obtained my bachelor degree of Engineering from School of Computer Science, Zhejiang University. 
My research focuses on network systems. I currently work on building real-time traffic analysing systems by utilizing techniques including software packet processing (e.g., DPDK), and blockchain consensus protocols (Layer 1).
